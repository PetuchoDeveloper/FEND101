# Hello there! 

Welcome to my **Client-side distributed programming** repo.
AKA: FEND101

###  What is this?
**TL;DR:** This is a compilation of my coursework for client-side distributed programming.

Here you'll find various projects, assignments, and experiments I've worked on as part of the course. It's a mix of frontend magic, distributed systems concepts, and probably a few bugs I pretend are features.
